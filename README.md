## App Description
This is a web based wishlist application using modern web frameworks. This will require the development of a Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), a constant integration, constant development (CICD) pipeline, and a persistence (Database) layer. The website will be deployed to a Platform as a Service (PaaS) such as Heroku or Google App Engine.
